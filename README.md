# putt-party
A recreation of the discord activity putt party with a LOT more features (hopefully)

## Playing
This game can be played [here](https://sollybunny.xyz/putt)  
If the server is down it can be played on [github](https://sollybunny.github.io/putt/)

## Running
This game runs of my [webserver](https://github.com/sollybunny/webserver) project.  
To run it this repository must be placed in `<filedir>/putt/` with `server.js` being a WSSCRIPT and SCRIPT in config.
