These folders are the old version of code that have been retired due to them being hard to expand, buggy or I just straight up didn't like them  
These are here purely for funzies, and they will never work nor will I edit them to make them workable.  
This whole game is my first venture into 3D rendering, physics, and map editing. As well as more complex server stuff. Please don't judge this horrid code you see before you.  
With that said, happy archeology-ing!
