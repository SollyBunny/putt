Nicer background
MORE settings

Editor:
Physics Modifier Areas
Polish UI
Add placeholder to ToolKit inputs
WIND!!!
Teleporters destination UI (yay bezier curves time)

Game:
Stroke / Hole counter
Bounce / hole / fall sound
Torture 1st person camera
In floor only calculate normals for surfaces which need them (ie top ones)
In wall, merge the  geometries into 1 mesh
Triangle collider is a sphere currently and.. not a triangle
X/TSpinners both have box colliders rather than respective shapes
Slopes activate collision every tick (thus sound goes wild)
Use hash to save world as THREE.JS/CANNON.JS data to load faster
Implement boosters, movers (tracks), text (again), fake players, teleporters (line to tp), coloring
Add physics objects to push around because why not?
Seesaws
Make lighting look nice
Make fog same color as sky color (somewhat done)
Fix the small indent on walls/halfwalls
Combine code for walls/halfwalls (give height paramater for walls?)
Combine code for all spinners (again, parameters for spinners?)
WIND!!!

Multiplayer:
When all in hole go to next hole
Count up scores
Score card
chat?

General:
Change all event handelers to passive (to avoid warns)
Global theming (dark/light/coffee mode)
Make global css and simplify my janky css in editor.html
Better naming convention for everything (types are in caps, classes are in proper, but only 1 capital, which is sometimes confusing)

This project is extremley out of hand
